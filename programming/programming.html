		<h2>Computing 4 at UML</h2>
		<p>Although I had programmed in previous years, the most notable programming occured in Comp 4. During the spring semester of my sophomore year I began Computing 4 at the Univeristy of Massachusetts Lowell. In this class we explored and utilitized various libraries in order to create programs and base level games that would allow for elements such as keyboard and mouse input. We also learned how to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and the library SFML.<p>
        <p>For our final assignment, we were tasked with creating a PDF comprised of every single project we completed that semester with questions, documentation, comments, and screenshots of the working product. In order to view that PDF, please click the following link.</p>
